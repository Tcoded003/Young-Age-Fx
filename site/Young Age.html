Let’s keep calm…we are getting to stage 3 soonest…

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:09 PM]
TODAY MARKS THE REAL BEGINNING OF YOUR FOREX JOURNEY 


IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN FOCUSED BEFORE , PLEASE START FROM TODAY.

ALL WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE IS INTRODUCTION, TODAY WE ARE STARTING THE MAIN FOUNDATION

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:09 PM]
We are Starting with the Topic

<h4 id="what_is_a_pip">WHAT IS A PIP</h4><BR />



PIP IS THE BEDROCK OF EVERYTHING, I REPEAT EVERYTHING WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING IN FOREX.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:09 PM]
If you miss the *Concept of Pips* here,  believe me  your foundation is going to be shaky all through your Forex journey.


Currencies are gauged in pips,  Trade orders are placed in pips,  Profits are calculated in pips.
Practically everything we are doing in Forex involves Pips. 

So take your time to understand this very Important topic.
<h5 id="bottom">Bottom</h5><BR />

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:11 PM]
Let’s now fire on


A PIP is the smallest unit in which a Currency pair can change.


It can also be said to be a standardized unit and  the smallest amount by which a currency pair in forex market can change

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:11 PM]
It’s just like the *CELL* of Forex


Though as u go further, U would learn that there are smaller versions called micropips.. 

But let’s not get anything complicated for now

Let’s now get to how to Calculate it


This is where I need maximum concentration from U all
..

If you are distracted before now, please stay focused from now onwards

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:12 PM]
For most currency pairs in Forex, We start Calculating the pips from the *4th decimal place*


However there are few exceptions.. 

We would start with the general ones, before we go to the exceptions

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:15 PM]
So before I start , Let me repeat 

The Pip is being calculated starting from the 4th decimal place. 

So ignore that number superscript beside all the pairs.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:17 PM]
[In reply to Trade With Ayo Fx]
Ignore the superscript…

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:17 PM]
[In reply to Trade With Ayo Fx]
And from the picture I uploaded above…you can see that most if them have 4 decimal figure..ignore the super script…

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:18 PM]
So am gonna be giving some examples now….as assumption….we are not gonna be using the ones in the pictures….but its all gonna be  4 decimal figure

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:20 PM]
So let’s get to it..

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:20 PM]
Let’s assume EURUSD is at the market value of 1.1292

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:20 PM]
Currency moves generally in Forex are measured and calculated in pips

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:20 PM]
Currency moves generally in Forex are measured and calculated in pips

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:21 PM]
So if EURUSD which is currently at 1.1292

Makes a move of 1 pip
<fieldset>
	<legend>Contact details</legend>
	<label>Email:<br />
		<input type="text" name="email" col="10" rows="2" /></label><br />
	<label>Address:<br />
		<input type="text" name="address" /></label><br />
	<label>Telephone:<br />
		<input type="number" name="number" /></label>
</fieldset>

It’s new value would become 1.1293

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:21 PM]
So how did I get 1.1293??

I added 1 to the 4th decimal placed number there and it increased from “2” to “3”

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:21 PM]
Very simple…

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:24 PM]
Let’s still have another example


Let’s Take a Look at GBPUSD (ie Pounds Vs US Dollars) 

Which is Currently at market price of 1.3031

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:25 PM]
Now if GBPUSD makes a move of 2 pips from that Current value 
..

It’s new Value would be at 1.3033


Now how do we get this 1.3033 ??

We added “2” to the 4th decimal placed number which is “1” and it increased to “3”

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:26 PM]
Let’s do one more Example…before we go to the main Calculation


Let’s take a look at EURGBP, which is at a Current market value of 0.8663

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:26 PM]
If EURGBP makes a move of 5 pips from that value of 0.8663

The New market value would be at 0.8668

How did we get that  ??

Once again,  we added “5” to the 4th decimal placed number which was “3” and we got “8”

Hence our new value was 0.8668

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:27 PM]
Let’s go a little bit higher

 I would give guys assignments  for you all to practice too after today’s Class 
 <form action="file:///C:/Users/user/Desktop/Tobi%20%20Website%20Books/Young-Age-Fx/site/index.html" method="post">
 	<label for="username">Username</label>

 	<label for="password">Password</label>
 	<input type="password" name="password" required="required" />
 	<input type="submit" value="submit">
 </form>



Assuming we were now told that GBPUSD made a move of *10 pips* from 1.3031

We would as usual add the figure 10 from the 4th placed decimal number and we would have our new value as

1.3031  >>>>  1.3041

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:29 PM]
Now for most currency pairs in Forex…. The pip Calculation,  starts from the 4th decimal place. 

Now there are some currency pairs that are not up to 4 decimal place. 


Some of them have specific ways of Calculating them .

Example of those pairs are
JPY pairs
Eg
USDJPY
EURJPY
GBPJPY
AUDJPY
NZDJPY etc 

Another popular Example is Gold 
Ie
XAUUSD

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:30 PM]
LETS START WITH *JPY PAIRS*


For JPY pairs Eg USDJPY….. The pips Calculation starts from the 2nd decimal place digit. If you notice that it’s not up to 4 decimal place like others that we did before… 

Let’s see some examples

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:36 PM]
Let’s assume USDJPY is at the market value of *109.67*

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:36 PM]
From that Value… If it makes a move of 2 pips. 

The New value would be at *109.69*

How did we get this 

We started adding “2” to the second decimal place number which is “7” and it increased to “9”

That’s how we got *109.69*

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:38 PM]
Let’s go a little bit higher

Assuming USDJPY made a move of 10 pips from that Value of 109.67

The new value by simply adding 10 from the 2nd decimal place number would be

109.77

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:39 PM]
Let’s now get to the last exception which is Gold

 By seeing how to Calculate pips on Gold ie XAUUSD 

Gold is represented as XAUUSD 

Because, if the Chemical Formula for Gold in the periodic table is AU

So some Brookers write it as XAUUSD instead of Gold

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:41 PM]
I usually Call *Gold* My Boss… 

The Volatility is the highest.. 

It can move 1000 pips on a good day

</p>

Only Gold can do that

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/11/20, 5:42 PM]
Let’s assume  the price of Gold is currently at 1325.36

….if it makes a move of 2 pips. 

The New value would be 1325.56

How did we get this??

 As usual using the shortcut method we added “2” to the 1st decimal place number which is the figure “3”

We are going to be moving on to 


*CONCEPT OF BID PRICE AND ASK PRICE*

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:13 PM]
[Photo]

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:13 PM]
Why are there 2 prices beside each quote. 


U know I always tell you guys that I like Teaching in steps that won’t overload you who is listening.

As we approach that area  we would tackle it and you would understand it better

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:13 PM]
Let’s now get to what they mean



*BID PRICE*  IS THE PRICE THAT BUYERS ARE WILLING TO BUY


WHILE 

*ASK PRICE*  IS THE PRICE THAT SELLERS ARE WILLING TO SELL

Write those definitions down. 

We would break it down now

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:18 PM]
From the Image above u would see something like 

*EURUSD* . 1.1586  1.1587



1.1586.   Is the *Bid Price*

While 


1.1587.  Is the *ASK Price*

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:18 PM]
As usual, I would use what is happening around us to explain these concepts. 

I always like simplifying things for my students.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:18 PM]
Forex is not meant to be hard,  it’s people that try to make it complex so as to monopolize the business for themselves.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:18 PM]
: Let’s say u receive $10,000 ,from a friend abroad.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:19 PM]
And u walk into a Bank to exchange it,    Bank would tell you that the latest CBN rate is let’s say #350.

So they would give #3.5 Million Naira as equivalent to the $1,000


Let’s say the next day.. 
U walk into that same back. 
U had an emergency and you needed to travel abroad and you are requesting for same $10,000.

They would now tell you that their own Bank rate is #370

So you would now have to pay #3.7 Million for same $10,000


In this situation, #350 here is the Bid price,  while #370 is the Ask price.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:19 PM]
That is how Bank makes their Money.

They just made #200,000 profit from U. 
In just a space of 24 hours. 


That is why Banks would always be King over the masses. 

They control the flow of money. 

And would always continue to live in Big houses and Drive Big cars and pay the workers peanuts.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:19 PM]
That is why, they would never want you to learn FOREX. 

Because Foreign Exchange is so Liquid that it can change your Fortune around in just few weeks of Trading. 

However this Monopoly of knowledge is being circulated among the Elites

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:20 PM]
Let’s come back to Forex
<p> In Forex, the Bid and Ask price work same way. 
However not as exuberant as the one Banks exploit us with. 

The difference between these 2 in forex is just in points.




So The Bid Price is that price that Buyers also in Forex are willing to Buy while

Ask price is the price that the Sellers are willing to sell. 


Here Buyers and sellers are not human beings.
It’s the market in this case.. 

You Buy from the market<img src="images/forex study.jpg" alt="studying forex" 
	width="200" height="300" align="left">  and Sell to the market.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:22 PM]
So the meaning of this above is that when you place a BUY ORDER in Forex 


It would activate for you using the Ask price 

(remember that the Ask price is the Price that Sellers are willing to Sell to U,  who is the Buyer) 

While in reverse



When you place a *SELL* ORDER in Forex 


It would activate for you using the BID price 

(remember that the BID price is the Price that Buyers are willing to Buy from U,  who is the Seller)

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:23 PM]
Let’s relate it to our example of banks above
</p>

In the Example I gave above,  


When you brought your $10,000 to the Bank, U are the seller at that instant while the Bank was the Buyer. 

So they gave you their Bid price of #350.
Because that is the price they are willing to Buy

While in reverse


When you came back the next day that you want to travel for an emergency 

U now became the Buyer (no longer the Seller) 

U needed to Buy dollars to Travel urgently.

Now the Bank in this case became the Seller. 

So they gave you the dollars at their Ask price which is the price that Sellers are willing to Sell (remember they are now the sellers)

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:25 PM]
Remember from the example I gave above 370 Naira was the Ask and it’s bigger than the Bid price which was 350 Naira



So Also in Forex… The Ask is also higher than the Bid price… 

Just like we saw in the example above 

EURUSD….. 1.1586  1.1587

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:25 PM]
Let’s now move to the next concept Related to them


*WHAT IS A SPREAD*


*SPREAD* is the difference between the BID and ASK price.

Trade With Ayo Fx, [8/13/20, 4:25 PM]
: In the example I gave above. 

The Spread is #370 - #350 = #20


The Spread is 20 Naira.</p>
